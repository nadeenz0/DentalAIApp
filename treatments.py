2. Treatment Options
A. Surgical Management
    • Conservative excision or enucleation
    • Curettage or radical resection depending on type
    • Peripheral ostectomy

B. Reconstructive Surgery
    • Bone grafts or prosthetics if needed

3. Follow-Up Care
    • Regular monitoring
    • Long-term follow-up for aggressive types

4. Functional & Esthetic Rehabilitation
    • Orthodontic/prosthetic treatment if needed

    "dental malignant tumors": """The treatment for dental malignant tumors (oral cancers): 

1. Diagnosis & Assessment
	•	Clinical examination: Ulcers, masses, induration, unexplained bleeding
	•	Biopsy: Incisional or excisional
	•	Imaging: CT, MRI, PET scan for staging
	•	Histopathology: To determine tumor type and grade
	•	Multidisciplinary team involvement: Oncology, maxillofacial surgery, radiology

2. Treatment Options

A. Surgical Management
	•	Wide local excision of tumor with safe margins
	•	Neck dissection if lymph node involvement
	•	Reconstructive surgery (if needed) for function and esthetics

B. Radiotherapy
	•	External beam radiation
	•	Often used post-surgery or as primary treatment if surgery not possible

C. Chemotherapy
	•	Used for advanced, metastatic, or inoperable cases
	•	Often combined with radiotherapy (chemoradiation)

3. Supportive & Adjunctive Care
	•	Pain management
	•	Nutritional support (especially if swallowing is affected)
	•	Oral hygiene maintenance
	•	Speech and swallowing therapy (post-treatment)

4. Follow-up & Monitoring
	•	Regular follow-up to detect recurrence or complications
	•	Long-term rehabilitation (prosthetics, implants if feasible) .""",
    "tooth discoloration": """The treatment for tooth discoloration :

1. Diagnosis & Assessment
	•	Identify type:
	•	Extrinsic (surface stains: food, drinks, smoking)
	•	Intrinsic (within tooth: trauma, fluorosis, tetracycline, pulp necrosis)
	•	Age-related (dentin thickening, enamel wear)
	•	Clinical and radiographic examination

2. Treatment Options

A. For Extrinsic Discoloration
	•	Scaling and polishing
	•	Air polishing
	•	Professional tooth whitening (external bleaching)

B. For Intrinsic Discoloration
	•	Vital bleaching: In-office or at-home bleaching with carbamide or hydrogen peroxide
	•	Non-vital bleaching: Internal bleaching for root canal–treated teeth
	•	Microabrasion: For mild fluorosis or superficial enamel defects
	•	Composite veneers or bonding: Mask deeper discoloration
	•	Porcelain veneers or crowns: For severe intrinsic staining or esthetic restoration

3. Prevention & Maintenance
	•	Avoid staining foods/drinks (coffee, tea, red wine)
	•	Maintain good oral hygiene
	•	Use whitening toothpaste (mild effect)
	•	Regular dental cleanings .""",
    "hypodontia": """The treatment for hypodontia :

1. Diagnosis & Assessment
	•	Clinical & radiographic exam (OPG, CBCT if needed)
	•	Identify missing teeth, assess space, occlusion, and facial growth
	•	Multidisciplinary planning (orthodontist, prosthodontist, oral surgeon)

2. Treatment Options

A. Orthodontic Management
	•	Space closure: Move adjacent teeth to close gaps
	•	Space opening: Maintain or create space for prosthetic replacement

B. Prosthetic Replacement
	•	Removable partial dentures (temporary or permanent)
	•	Resin-bonded bridges (for small gaps or young patients)
	•	Conventional bridges (when abutment teeth are suitable)
	•	Dental implants (after growth completion)

C. Restorative Enhancement
	•	Build-up or reshape adjacent teeth to improve aesthetics or function
